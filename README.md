# mRICH2
This repository is for the standalone GEANT4 simulation of the modular RICH (mRICH) detector which which developed for Electron Ion Collider experiments. The design goal of the mRICH detector is to provide charged kaon and pion separation in momentum range from 3 ro 10 GeV/c and electron and pion separation around 2 GeV/c.
